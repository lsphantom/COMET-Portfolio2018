	<h3>About this project</h3>
	<p>COMET develops effective simulations that allow learners to make adjustments in a safe environment. This <a href="https://www.meted.ucar.edu/training_module.php?id=1300">lesson</a> introduces National Weather Service forecasters to the communication strategies used for decision support services during wildland fire incidents. The branching simulation below is a great way for learners to see how and why they may need to modify their communication with fire partners. After three tries, it offers specific feedback about things that learners need to improve.</p>

	<h3>Communications Simulation</h3>
	<p>This simulation will give you a chance to apply what you already know about communicating fire weather information to National Weather Service (NWS) partners.  You will take the role of a NWS meteorologist communicating fire weather information to a Fire Operations Chief via a teleconference.  Your partner’s reaction and decisions will change based on your selections.</p>

	<p>There are three questions in this simulation.  To complete the simulation successfully, you will need to select the correct answer for all three questions.  Feedback is available only after you complete the simulation.  You will have three attempts to complete the simulation successfully.  Launch the simulation when you are ready.</p>

	<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> In July, drought and lightning strikes have led to a number of large fires across northwest California and southwest Oregon. Thousands of firefighters and multiple Incident Management Teams are deployed across the region, and resources are stretched thin. It is August, and for a second time this month, thunderstorms are forecast to roll through the region as a small cut-off low lingers off the California coast.</p>
	<p>You are a forecaster in the Medford, Oregon Weather Forecast Office (WFO) and you are working with 5 Incident Meterologists (IMETs) on various fires, and a couple of Type II teams that do not have IMETs assigned to them yet. One of those Type II fires without an IMET is the Little Deer fire in Siskiyou County, California.</p>
	<p>An earlier call with the IMETs revealed that they are frustrated by the inability to use the models to develop a sense of timing or intensity for the thunderstorms.  The firefighters are very worried about control issues due to erratic winds. The HRRR model guidance indicates thunderstorms developing between 16:00 and 18:00 PDT.  The Storm Prediction Center has a general risk of convection for the day.  One limiting factor is that recent thunderstorms have tempered fuels with the humidity not much below 30%, so you do not expect many new fire starts. The weather could be a problem for existing fires, but the risk for starting new fires is low. </p>

	<p>You receive a call from an Operations Section Chief at the Little Deer fire.  The Operations Chief explains that they have National Guard troops in the field fighting the fire. Their main operational constraint is that their vehicles are not enclosed in the back, just tarped. If a thunderstorm develops, their only option is to disengage 90 minutes ahead of any storms to drive back to Yreka.  This will limit the risk that the troops will be struck by lightning, either on the line or in the back of the trucks.  This also limits how far they are going to let the troops hike off the roads without adding too much time to their 90 minute window.</p>

Thunderstorms west of the Sierra Crest are pretty rare in August, so while the model is usually pretty good, this is a scenario where I am not sure I can trust it, especially on timing.  If thunderstorms form, some of them could develop overhead, and will need a quick decision for line personnel to head to shelter. You will probably be okay until 16:00, but if you hear radio chatter on other fires about IMETs issuing weather alerts, that could be your cue to take action. </label>

This pattern is pretty rare and other forecasters are struggling with it.  If it were easy, more people will be able do it.  I am not comfortable with issuing a Red Flag Warning based on the current conditions in order to avoid message fatigue.  Your teams need to have a lookout and if they see cumulus clouds developing they need to head back to shelter.  If those clouds do not develop, they can continue their work without interruption.</label>

		<p>The Operations Sections Chief follows up with this question “I waited an hour for you and the best you can do is tell me what is happening at Burney and Chico.  I don’t really care what is happening there.  I need to know what will be the situation over the Little Deer fire. You sound pretty sure that thunderstorms will reach the fire today sometime between noon and 18:00. That is a pretty big time window and is not helping me plan the work or what to tell my crews.  Can you at least tell me what will be the main impacts?”</p>

				<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" style="color: limegreen"></span> Well done!  Your communication effort was successful.  You described the weather threat by relating it to the partner’s concerns.  The timing, location, and confidence descriptions were appropriate and free of meteorological jargon.  You also avoided mentioning Red Flag Warning when the criteria were not met.  Lastly, you communicated the impacts well and offered how the Operations Chief could monitor the situation, which will assist with decision-making.</p>

				<p>The storms developed around 14:30 and reached the fire.  The National Guard troops were told to disengage and hike back to their trucks at 13:45.  They were in their trucks and halfway back to their Incident Command Post (90 minute drive) when they got a bit of rain on them. But, a lightning strike was observed in the area they had been working on the fire at about 15:30.  All crews were able to work as long as possible and get safely to the trucks and shelter.</p>

			<p id="fws-1b" class="fws-feedback hidden"><em>Question 1</em><br>The weather threat was described in terms of model performance and concerns from IMETs rather than relating it to the partner’s concern.</p>
			<p id="fws-1c" class="fws-feedback hidden"><em>Question 1</em><br>The weather threat was described in terms of convection risk and the need for a Red Flag Warning rather than relating it to the partner’s concern. Additionally, mentioning the phrase Red Flag Warning could distract from your message because Red Flag Warning is not what you are expecting.  It may be better to simply say, “Any thunderstorms should result in very few to no new starts because of the recent rain”.</p>

			<p id="fws-2b" class="fws-feedback hidden"><em>Question 2</em><br>The timing, location, and confidence level was obscured by meteorological jargon.  That makes it difficult to select a course of action.  Since the Chief waited an hour and the information makes it difficult to make a decision, this will increase the frustration level.</p>
			<p id="fws-2c" class="fws-feedback hidden"><em>Question 2</em><br>The timing lacked the necessary temporal resolution and it was unclear how the geographical information relates to the area of the fire.

			<p id="fws-3aab" class="fws-feedback hidden"><em>Question 3</em><br>There was little description of the potential impacts and since the Little Deer fire has no IMET assigned, they will have to listen to messages about other fires rather than their own.</p>

It may be better to simply say, “Any thunderstorms should result in very few to no new starts because of the recent rain”.<br> The use of words like “if” and phrases like “I am not comfortable” lead toward a low degree of confidence in the provided information.  
While one always needs to be cognizant about message fatigue, sometimes the weather goes through rare cycles where impacts seem to occur on a daily basis. Given the risk to the firefighters exposed outside, it is important to take each event on its own merits. It is necessary to always make the maximum effort to ensure firefighter safety, despite our own biases.</p>
